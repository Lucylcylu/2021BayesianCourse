## 一、定义 Definition

观察者偏差是在观察性和干预性研究中影响评估的一种检测偏差。它发生在当观察者(或调查者)的信念或期望可以影响研究中收集的数据的研究中。它发生在观察和记录信息的过程，这其中也包括与真实值的系统性差异。

许多医疗保健类地观察都有可能出现系统性的变化。例如，在评估医学图像时，一个观察者可能记录异常，而另一个观察者可能不会记录。不同的观察者可能倾向于将同一个测量尺度做出向上或向下地取整。不同的观察者会在颜色变化测试中对颜色有不同的理解。当主观判断是观察的一部分时，观察者之间存在很大的差异性，其中一些差异可能是系统性的，并导致偏见的产生。对于客观数据的观察，如死亡，观察者偏差的风险要低得多。

记录客观数据的偏差可能是由于在使用测量设备或数据源方面的培训不足，或者是没有检查的不良习惯造成的。在记录主观数据中，观察者的个人倾向有可能成为观察者偏见的基础。观察者可能在一定程度上会意识到他们自己对某项研究的偏见，也有可能在记录研究信息时没有意识到那些影响他们决定的因素。

随机对照试验旨在提供最公平的干预测试。然而，如果数据收集过程的任何部分涉及到了观察，那么研究中的测量就会被观察者偏差影响。

Observer bias is a type of detection bias that can affect assessment in observational and interventional studies. It occurs in research when the beliefs or expectations of an observer (or investigator) can influence the data that’s collected in a study. It is in the process of observing and recording information which includes systematic discrepancies from the truth.

Many healthcare observations are open to systematic variation. For example, in the assessment of medical images, one observer might record an abnormality but another might not. Different observers might tend to round up or round down a measurement scale. Colour change tests can be interpreted differently by different observers. Where subjective judgement is part of the observation, there is great potential for variability between observers, and some of these differences might be systematic and lead to bias. Observation of objective data, such as death, is at much lower risk of observer bias.

Biases in recording objective data may result from inadequate training in the use of measurement devices or data sources or unchecked bad habits. By recording subjective data, predispositions of the observer are likely to underpin observer biases. Observers might be somewhat conscious of their own biases about a study or may be unaware of factors influencing their decisions when recording study information.

Randomized controlled trials are designed to provide the fairest test of an intervention. However, if any part of the data collection process involves observation, observer bias can affect the measurement in the study.

## 二、案例 Examples

### （一）水银血压仪 Mercury Sphygmomanometers

观察者偏差已经在血压研究中被反复证实。临床医生使用水银血压计来测量参与者的血压，这种方法将读数上下调整来接近一个整数。如果研究人员因为对血压地标准值是多少有先入为主的想法，从而对读数的任意调整，那么也会导致观察者偏差。

Observer bias has been repeatedly been documented in studies of blood pressure. Clinicians measuring participants blood pressure using mercury sphygmomanometers have been found to round up, or down, readings to the nearest whole number. Observer bias may also occur if the researcher has a preconceived idea of what the blood pressure ought to be, leading to arbitrary adjustments of the readings.

### （二）聪明的汉斯 Clever Hans

在20世纪初，有一匹名叫克莱尔 · 汉斯的马，据说它的算术能力极其出色。它的主人，威廉 · 冯 · 奥尔森会问克莱尔 · 汉斯各种各样的问题，包括加法、减法、乘法和其他算术运算。汉斯会轻敲它的蹄子来告诉答案。

![CleverHans](https://bkimg.cdn.bcebos.com/pic/bba1cd11728b471041ce0ba3cfcec3fdfd0323f8 "Clever Hans in 1904")

心理学家 Oskar pfunst对此感到惊讶。于是他调查了这件事，发现克莱尔 · 汉斯只有在它主人知道问题的正确答案时才能提供正确答案。事实证明，当 Clever Hans 接近正确的敲击次数时，它的主人威廉 · 冯 · 奥尔森会开始以某种方式做出反应，表示汉斯应该停止敲击。

主人会下意识给汉斯一些微妙的提示，告诉它正确的敲击次数。但是，当主人自己也不知道他问的问题的答案时，汉斯就无法给出正确的答案，因为主人没有给出任何微妙的提示，告诉它什么时候停止敲击。

这是观察者偏差的一个例子，因为主人的期望导致克莱尔·汉斯以某种方式行动，从而导致错误的数据。

In the early 1900’s there was a horse named Clever Hans that was claimed to have the ability to do arithmetic extremely well. The owner, Wilhelm Von Olson, would ask Clever Hans different questions that involved adding, subtracting, multiplying, and other arithmetic operations and Clever Hans would provide an answer by tapping his hoof a certain number of times.

Amazed by this, psychologist Oskar Pfungst investigated this situation and found that Clever Hans could only provide the correct answer when the owner actually knew the correct answer to the question. It turns out that when Clever Hans would approach the correct number of taps to make, the owner Wilhelm Von Olson would start to react in a certain way which signaled that Hans should stop tapping.

Without realizing it, the owner was giving subtle cues to Hans about the correct number of taps to make. But when the owner himself didn’t know the answer to the questions he was asking, 

Hans was unable to produce the correct answer because the owner didn’t make any subtle cues on when to stop tapping.

This is an example of observer bias because the expectations of the owner caused Clever Hans to act in a certain way, which resulted in faulty data. 

### （三）聪明和愚笨的老鼠 Smart&Dull Rats

1963年，心理学家罗伯特·罗森塔尔让两组学生测试老鼠。尽管这些老鼠事实上都是同一类型的标准实验室老鼠，它们在完成迷宫的能力上被划分为两类：“聪明”或“迟钝”。

研究结果表明，那些认为自己在对付“聪明”的老鼠的学生们以某种方式表现自己的老鼠有更大的可能完成迷宫。然而，认为自己在对付“迟钝”的老鼠的学生的行为方式降低了老鼠完成迷宫的机会。

事实证明，学生的期望影响了不同组的老鼠的表现。

In 1963, psychologist Robert Rosenthal had two groups of students test rats. The rats were categorized as being "bright" or "dull" in their ability to complete mazes, even though in reality they were all the same type of standard lab rat.

The results of the study showed that the students who thought they were handling “bright” rats behaved in certain ways to make sure that the rats had a better chance of completing the maze while the students who thought they were handling “dull”rats behaved in ways that reduced the rats chances of completing the mazes.

It turns out that the expectations of the students influenced how well the different groups of rats performed.

## 三、影响 Impact

Hróbjartsson 和他的同事们通过比较结果评估员不知道干预措施的研究和结果评估员知道干预措施的研究，提出了三份评估观察者偏差影响程度的系统性综述。他们对三种类型的随机对照试验进行了调查，分别是: 二元结果试验、具有测量尺度结果的随机对照试验和有事件发生时间结果的随机对照试验。

这些研究包括了从心绞痛到伤口治疗再到精神疾病的一系列情况。对于二元结果的随机对照试验，不使用盲法的结果评估者产生的优势比平均被夸大了36%。对于使用测量尺度结果的临床试验，不使用盲法的结果评估夸大了68%。对于使用事件发生时间结果的随机对照试验，不使用盲法的评估将风险率夸大了约27%。

Hróbjartsson and colleagues produced three systematic reviews estimating the size of the impact of observer bias, by comparing estimates from studies in which outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention with those in which outcome assessors were not blinded. Three types of RCTs were investigated: those with binary outcomes; RCTs with measurement scale outcomes and RCTs with time-to-event outcomes.

The studies included a range of conditions from angina to wound treatment to psychiatric disorders. For RCTs with binary outcomes, non-blinded outcome assessors generated odds ratios that, on average, were exaggerated by 36%. For clinical trials that used measurement scale outcomes, non-blinded outcome assessment exaggerated effect size by 68% . For RCTs using time-to-event outcomes, non-blinded assessment overstated the hazard ratio by approximately 27%.

## 四、预防措施 Preventive steps

一个关键的方法是确保结果评估人员不知道研究参与者的暴露状况。这可以适用于随机对照试验，即个人被分配到一个特定的干预措施，也可以适用于观察性研究，即跟踪不同暴露环境下的研究参与者的进展。实现盲法可能意味着将暴露数据的获取与结果数据分开; 在盲法试验中，整个研究过程中分配应保持未知（除非出于安全原因必须披露）。

方法还可以包括对观察员进行如何记录调查结果的充分培训，在记录开始之前查明任何潜在的冲突，并明确界定收集数据的方法、工具和时限。

另一个预防方面包括培训研究观察员，使其意识到自己的偏见和习惯，以提高准确性。有一项关于血压的研究着眼于减少观察者偏见的训练程序，以及它们能持续多久。研究表明，护士在报告血压时有偏见，要么少报，要么多报；培训确实减少了护士之间的差异，但差异仍然存在，而且也没有因不同的时间点上培训而改变。

虽然观察者的偏见可以减少，但是观察者的偏见很可能会一直存在，研究人员在分析和评估数据时应该意识到这一点。

A key method is to ensure that outcome assessors are blinded to the exposure status of study participants. This can apply to randomized controlled trials, in which an individual has been allocated a particular intervention, and also to observational studies, which track the progress of study participants with different exposures. Achieving blinding might mean separating access for data on exposures from data on outcomes; in a blinded trial the allocation should remain unknown throughout the study (unless it must be revealed for safety reasons).

Strategies can also include adequate training for observers in how to record findings, identifying any potential conflicts before recordings commence and clearly defining the methods, tools and time frames for collecting data.

Another preventive aspect includes training study observers to become aware of their prejudices and habits, in order to improve accuracy. One study on blood pressure looked at training procedures designed to reduce observer bias and how long they lasted. The study showed nurses had biases in either under or over reporting blood pressure; training did reduce the between-nurse variation but differences remained and were not changed by training at various time points.

Whilst observer bias can be reduced, it is likely that observer bias will always remain, and researchers should be aware of this when analysing and evaluating data.
